    <textOnly>Hello {!Retail_Live_Email__c.OwnerFirstName},

You have successfully created a Retail LIVE email but there was an issue mapping it to either a BRAND or a VILLAGE using hashtag #, or your VR user record does not have an associated Department.


Brand: {!Retail_Live_Email__c.Brand_Reference__c}
Village: {!Retail_Live_Email__c.Village__c}
Department: {!Retail_Live_Email__c.Department__c}

Please amend this Retail LIVE email by clicking the link below

https://valueretail.my.salesforce.com/{!Retail_Live_Email__c.Id}


How Tagging works

To automatically associate Retail LIVE emails to Villages &amp; Brands you must include 2 tag references in the body of your Retail LIVE email.


In this order

# followed by your 2-digit Village code:  BV, LR, LZ, LV, FV, MV, WV, IV, KV

# followed by the Brand name, no spaces


Example, to associate a Retail LIVE email with Bicester &amp; Ted Baker you must enter the following in the body of the email.


#BV

#TedBaker


Tip!

Add  &quot;+++&quot; to remove all signature information from the Retail LIVE email so this information does not get posted to the dashboard keeping everything neat and tidy.


#BV

#TedBaker

Thank you,
